# The roller coaster problem

## This problem is from Andrews’s Concurrent Programming [1], but he attributes it to J. S. Herman’s Master’s thesis.

### Suppose there are n passenger threads and a car thread. The passengers repeatedly wait to take rides in the car, which can hold C passengers, where C < n. The car can go around the tracks only when it is full.

#### Here are some additional details:

+ Passengers should invoke **board** and **unboard**.
+ The car should invoke **load**, **run** and **unload**.
+ Passengers cannot board until the car has invoked **load**.
+ The car cannot depart until *C* passengers have boarded
+ Passengers cannot unboard until the car has invoked **unload**.
